If there is a disparity (for example the SPY implication is much higher than that of its constituents), on average the speculative premiums for SPY Calls are likely overvalued and the speculative premiums for Constiuent Puts are undervalued. You could potentially exploit this by selling the overvalued and buying the undervalued (by basketing options). This is something I was unable to test due to lack of data. "

    "##### To wrap up, I wanted to provide a brief justification for not using OTM contracts as part of the calculation. To do so, let's go back to our example of the Call Option with a Strike of $\\$100$. If the underlying is instead at $\\$90$ and is therefore $\\$10$ out of the money, a reasonable price could be $\\$1.20$ (Naturally the price is entirely speculative premium). There is two issues, with basing an implication on this: \n",
    "- Saying this implies the market will increase by $\\$1.20$ means the buyer of the call option will still lose the entire price he paid for the option (as he can just buy for $\\$91.20$ instead of the $\\$100$ given by the option)\n",
    "-  OTM prices do not scale linearly as with ITM. The intrinsic value of a Call Option is essentially a ReLU function being at 0 until the underlying hits the Strike, then scaling linearly. Since Options prices are obviously nonnegative, it is unfair to say that a contract $\\$5$ OTM is worth $\\geq$ $\\$5$ more than a contract that is $\\$10$ OTM in the way you could say that an option $\\$10$ ITM is worth $\\geq$ $\\$5$ more than a contract only $5 ITM. \n",
